# CodeTrottersChallenge
This repository contains my Python solution for the 2015 Code Troters Chalange.  

The challenge was to write a function called int_to_word that takes as an input an integer parameter and returns the associated English word.
You can assume the function will never receive a number greater than 999,999,999.
